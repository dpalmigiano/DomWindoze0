## A QubesOS ultra-simple shell script to help take the guesswork out of what the heck went wrong with your Windows install.
This is a work in progress. Windows is giving me the BSOD, expect a working update within the next few days.
## Guide:
This is simply an adaptation of the [guide in the QubesOS documentation].(https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/windows-vm/) 

[I assume this will also be useful.](https://www.militant.dk/2019/01/06/windows-10-on-qubes-os-4-0/)

### Be safe and protect Dom0:
1) Understand the code you execute in Dom0.
1) Type it by hand.
